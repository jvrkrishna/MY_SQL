#Auto commit mode
    As we know By default all DDL command are auto committed.
    Bt default, many databases operate in auto commit mode, where each individual SQL statements is automatically committed.
    In auto commit mode each SQL statement is transaction.
    To execute multiple statements as single transaction, we must explicitly start the transaction.

    START TRANSACTION;
    BEGIN;

#TO disable Auto commit mode:
    SET autocommit=0;

        or
    SET autocommit OFF;

#TO enable Auto commit mode:
    SET autocommit=1;

        or
    SET autocommit ON;

#### We cannot disable auto commit mode of DDL commands.
