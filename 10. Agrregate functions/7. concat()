This is not a pure aggregate function, but you can use it in queries like:
SELECT CONCAT(NAME, ' - ', DEPT) AS Employee_Info FROM EMP_INFO;
üî∏ Output:
    Ravi - HR
    Anita - IT
    Suman - Finance
    .....

If you want to concatenate values across multiple rows (not standard in all databases), you can use:

GROUP_CONCAT() in MySQL:
SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(NAME) AS All_Names FROM EMP_INFO;

SELECT DEPT, COUNT(*) AS Count, AVG(SALARY) AS Avg_Salary
FROM EMP_INFO
GROUP BY DEPT;
