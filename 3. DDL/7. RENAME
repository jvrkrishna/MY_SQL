RENAME command is used to change the database objects like table, column etc.
Generally, Rename command is used along with ALTER command.

Rename a table
Syntax:
    RENAME table <old_Table_Name> to <New_Table_Name>;

Rename multiple table name at a time
Syntax:
    RENAME table <old_Table_Name> to <New_Table_Name>,
                 <old_Table_Name> to <New_Table_Name>,
                 <old_Table_Name> to <New_Table_Name>;

✅ 1. Rename a Table Using ALTER with RENAME
Syntax:
ALTER TABLE old_table_name RENAME TO new_table_name;

Example:
ALTER TABLE employee RENAME TO staff;
This renames the table employee to staff.

✅ 2. Rename a Column Using ALTER with RENAME COLUMN
Syntax:
ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN old_column_name TO new_column_name;

Example:
ALTER TABLE employee RENAME COLUMN NAME TO full_name;
This changes the column NAME to full_name in the employee table.

✅ 3. Rename Multiple Columns (MySQL 8.0+ and some other databases)
Some databases (like PostgreSQL) do not support renaming multiple columns in a single command. MySQL 8.0 also does not support renaming multiple columns at once directly.

So you must rename columns one by one:
ALTER TABLE employee RENAME COLUMN NAME TO full_name;

ALTER TABLE employee RENAME COLUMN ADDRESS TO location;


✅ 4. We can rename multiple tables at once in MySQL, using a single RENAME TABLE statement.

RENAME TABLE old_table1 TO new_table1,
             old_table2 TO new_table2,
             old_table3 TO new_table3;
