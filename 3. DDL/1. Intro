1. Introduction to DDL (Data Definition Language)
    DDL stands for Data Definition Language.
    It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language).
    The main purpose of DDL is to create, modify, and delete database objects.
    DDL is used to define and manage the structure of database objects such as:
    . Databases
    . Tables
    . Views
    . Procedures
    . Functions
    . Triggers, etc.

ðŸ“Œ Common DDL Commands:
. CREATE â€“ To create a new database object (e.g., table, view)
. ALTER â€“ To modify an existing database object
. DROP â€“ To permanently delete a database object
. TRUNCATE â€“ To remove all data from a table, but keep its structure
. RENAME â€“ To rename a database object (supported in some DBMSs)
