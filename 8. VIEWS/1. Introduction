View is virtual table constructed from existing table or tables.
A view can be created from one or more tables which depends on the written SQL query to create a view.
A view can contain all rows of a table or selected rows from a table.
Most of the operations that can carried on a table can be carried out on view. Any updating of rows in the table will automatically reflect in the view.
Changes made in table reflects on view (100%).
Changes made in view reflects on table (But the columns are same in both view  and table).

Adv:
    provide data security and confidentally.
    view use little storage space.
    provides a customised view for user.
    Redundancy problem does not arise.

Dis-adv:
    Cannot be indexed.
    May or Maynot be directly updatable.

SYNTAX:
    Create view <viewname> as select <cols-list> from <tablename> where <condition>;

Practical:
üß± Step 1: Create the Main Table
    CREATE TABLE EMP_INFO (
        ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
        NAME VARCHAR(50),
        DEPT VARCHAR(30),
        SALARY INT
    );

‚ûï Step 2: Insert Sample Records
    INSERT INTO EMP_INFO (ID, NAME, DEPT, SALARY) VALUES
    (101, 'Ravi', 'HR', 45000),
    (102, 'Anita', 'IT', 70000),
    (103, 'Suman', 'Finance', 85000),
    (104, 'John', 'IT', 90000),
    (105, 'Priya', 'HR', 40000);

üëÅÔ∏è Step 3: Create a View with a Condition
Create a view that shows employees with a salary over 60,000:
    CREATE VIEW high_salary_employees AS
    SELECT ID, NAME, SALARY
    FROM EMP_INFO
    WHERE SALARY > 60000;

üîç Step 4: Query the View
    SELECT * FROM high_salary_employees;

Expected Output:
    ID   |  NAME   | SALARY
    -----|---------|--------
    102  | Anita   | 70000
    103  | Suman   | 85000
    104  | John    | 90000

‚úèÔ∏è Step 5: Update Data Through the View
Update salary for ID 102 using the view:
    UPDATE high_salary_employees
    SET SALARY = 75000
    WHERE ID = 102;

‚úÖ Now check the base table:
    SELECT * FROM EMP_INFO WHERE ID = 102;

‚ùå Step 6: Drop the View
    DROP VIEW high_salary_employees;
