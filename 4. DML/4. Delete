🗑️ DELETE Statement in MySQL
The DELETE command is used to remove records from a table.
You can delete specific rows using a WHERE clause or delete all rows by omitting it.

✅ Syntax:
    DELETE FROM <table_name> WHERE condition;

If you omit the WHERE clause, all rows in the table will be deleted:
    DELETE FROM <table_name>;

🧪 Practical Example
🛠️ Create Table:
    CREATE TABLE EMP_INFO (
        ID INT,
        NAME VARCHAR(20),
        JDATE DATE,
        SALARY FLOAT
    );

    DESC EMP_INFO;

📥 Insert Data:
    INSERT INTO EMP_INFO VALUES
    (1, 'Ram',  '2019-10-22', 25000),
    (2, 'Raju', '2020-08-12',  8900),
    (3, 'Ravi', '2018-07-28', 28000),
    (4, 'Rahul','2018-02-21', 75000),
    (5, 'Raghu','2018-03-21', 61000);

    SELECT * FROM EMP_INFO;

❓ DELETE Queries
🔸 Q1: Delete employees with salaries below 10,000
        DELETE FROM EMP_INFO WHERE SALARY < 10000;

        SELECT * FROM EMP_INFO;

🔸 Q2: Delete employees with salaries between 60,000 and 76,000
    DELETE FROM EMP_INFO WHERE SALARY > 60000 AND SALARY < 76000;

    SELECT * FROM EMP_INFO;

🔸 Q3: Delete the employee named 'Ram'
    DELETE FROM EMP_INFO WHERE NAME = 'Ram';

    SELECT * FROM EMP_INFO;

🔸 Q4: Delete Duplicate Records (Advanced)
    Assuming EMP_INFO had duplicate names and IDs (not a real case with proper primary keys), use:

    DELETE e1
    FROM EMP_INFO e1, EMP_INFO e2
    WHERE e1.NAME = e2.NAME
    AND e1.ID > e2.ID;

⚠️ This is a self-join technique used when no PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraint is defined. Prefer using constraints to prevent duplicates.

🔸 Q5: Delete all records from the table
    DELETE FROM EMP_INFO;

    -- or
    TRUNCATE TABLE EMP_INFO;


🔍 DELETE     vs      TRUNCATE

Feature	               DELETE	                         TRUNCATE
Uses WHERE clause?	   ✅ Yes	                        ❌ No
Rollback possible?	   ✅ Yes (if inside a transaction)	❌ No    
                                                        (auto-committed)
Affects Triggers?	   ✅ Yes	                        ❌ No
Resets Auto-Increment? ❌ No	                            ✅ Yes
Speed (large tables)   🐢 Slower (row-by-row)	         🚀 Faster

🧠 Conclusion:
Use DELETE when:
    . You need row-level control (via WHERE).
    . You may want to rollback later.
    . You need to fire triggers on delete.

Use TRUNCATE when:
    . You want to quickly remove all rows.
    . You don’t need rollback or row-level logic.
