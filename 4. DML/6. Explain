In MySQL, EXPLAIN (or EXPLAIN PLAN) is a command that shows how MySQL executes a query. It's a key tool for analyzing and optimizing SQL queries, helping you understand:

Which indexes are used (or not used)
The order in which tables are read (join order)
The estimated number of rows MySQL will need to examine
Whether temporary tables or filesorts are used

---->DESC EMP_info;
show  indexes from emp_info;
explain SELECT Name from emp_info where salary='10k';
