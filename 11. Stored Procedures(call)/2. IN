#IN PARAMETER:
    The IN parameter is used to pass data into the stored procedure.
    Once inside the procedure or function, the value of the IN parameter cannot be modified.
    In MySQL, when you define a parameter in a stored procedure without specifying the direction (IN, OUT, or INOUT), the default is IN.
    The IN parameter is read-only. You can use it to refer to the value that was passed in, but you cannot modify it inside the procedure.
    It's primarily used for passing values that you need to use for queries, conditions, or calculations within the procedure.


🔹 Step 4: Create Procedure with an IN Parameter
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE get_Stu_by_salary(IN min_salary INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM EMP_INFO WHERE SALARY >= min_salary;
END $$

DELIMITER ;

🔸 Now call it like this:
    CALL get_Stu_by_salary(8500);
🟢 Returns all employees with salary >= 8500

🔹 Step 5: Drop a Procedure
    DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS get_Stu_info;
    DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS get_Stu_by_salary;

📝 Notes:
    IN – sends a value into the procedure
    OUT – returns a value from the procedure
    INOUT – sends a value into and gets back an updated value
