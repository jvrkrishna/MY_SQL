#IN PARAMETER:
    The IN parameter is used to pass data into the stored procedure.
    Once inside the procedure or function, the value of the IN parameter cannot be modified.
    In MySQL, when you define a parameter in a stored procedure without specifying the direction (IN, OUT, or INOUT), the default is IN.
    The IN parameter is read-only. You can use it to refer to the value that was passed in, but you cannot modify it inside the procedure.
    It's primarily used for passing values that you need to use for queries, conditions, or calculations within the procedure.


Example:
    DELIMITER $$
        CREATE PROCEDURE get_Stu_id(IN employee_id INT)
        BEGIN
        SELECT * FROM EMP_INFO WHERE id = employee_id;
        END $$
    DELIMITER ;

call get_Stu_id(2);
