#OUT PARAMETER:
    An OUT parameter in MySQL is used to return a value from a stored procedure to the caller. Unlike IN parameters, which are used to pass values into the stored procedure, OUT parameters are used to send values out of the procedure.
    Unlike IN parameters, OUT parameters can be modified within the stored procedure. The value of an OUT parameter is set or updated by the procedure and is available to the caller once the procedure finishes executing.
    OUT parameters do not need to be initialized before calling the procedure. They are set by the procedure itself.
    You can use multiple OUT parameters to return several values from a procedure. This allows you to send multiple results back to the calling program.


Example:
DROP procedure if exists count_ids;

DELIMITER $$
    CREATE PROCEDURE count_ids(OUT totalcount INT)
    BEGIN
        SELECT count(*) INTO totalcount FROM EMP_INFO;
    END $$
DELIMITER ;

-- First call to procedure
SET @id = 0;
CALL count_ids(@id);

-- Now @id should hold the count from EMP_INFO, let's check the value
SELECT @id;

-- Second call with @addToNumber
SET @addToNumber = 100;
CALL count_ids(@id);

-- Final calculation
SET @totalAddition = @addToNumber + @id;
SELECT @totalAddition;
