In MySQL, the CALL command is used to invoke a stored procedure. A stored procedure is a group of SQL statements. If you have a situation, where you write the same query again and again, you can save that specific query as a stored procedure and call by its name.
You must use DELIMITER to define procedures if they contain semicolons inside.

#HOW TO CREATE STORE PROCEDURE:
    DELIMITER $$
        CREATE PROCEDURE `get_Stu_info` ()
        BEGIN
        SELECT * FROM EMP_INFO;
        END $$
    DELIMITER ;

Another Example:
    DELIMITER $$
        CREATE PROCEDURE `get_Stu_address` ()
        BEGIN
        SELECT Address FROM EMP_INFO;
        END $$
    DELIMITER ;

#HOW TO EXECUTE STORE PROCEDURE:
    call get_Stu_info;

#HOW TO DROP THE PROCEDURE:
    DROP procedure if exists get_Stu_info;

Notes:
You can pass IN, OUT, and INOUT parameters.
